# Error Fix Guide

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ‚úÖ BrowserProvider Constructor Error
**Error**: `TypeError: i.BrowserProvider is not a constructor`

**Fix**: Updated to use the correct ethers.js v5 syntax:
```javascript
// Before (v6 syntax - causing error)
const provider = new ethers.BrowserProvider(window.ethereum);

// After (v5 syntax - working)
const provider = new ethers.providers.Web3Provider(window.ethereum);
```

### 2. ‚úÖ WalletConnect Configuration Error
**Error**: `Origin https://theme613.github.io not found on Allowlist`

**Fix**: Updated WalletConnect configuration to use a default project ID for development.

### 3. ‚úÖ Simplified Contract Integration
**Fix**: Replaced complex contract service with direct ethers.js contract calls for better compatibility.

## üîß Configuration Required

### 1. Environment Variables
Create a `.env.local` file in your project root:

```bash
# Contract Addresses (update these with your deployed contract addresses)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SBT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUBSCRIPTION_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYMENT_GATEWAY_ADDRESS=0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
NEXT_PUBLIC_MOCK_PYUSD_ADDRESS=0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000

# WalletConnect Project ID (optional for development)
NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID=default_project_id
```

### 2. Deploy Contracts
Deploy your contracts and update the addresses:

```bash
# Deploy to local network for testing
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost

# Deploy to Sepolia testnet
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network sepolia
```

### 3. Update Contract Addresses
After deployment, copy the contract addresses and update your `.env.local` file.

## üöÄ How It Works Now

### SBT Minting Process
1. User clicks "Mint SBT" button
2. MetaMask popup appears for transaction confirmation
3. User confirms transaction
4. Real blockchain transaction is sent
5. Transaction is confirmed and SBT is minted

### PYUSD Payment Process
1. User clicks "Pay with PYUSD" button
2. MetaMask popup appears for transaction confirmation
3. User confirms transaction
4. Real PYUSD payment is processed
5. Payment is confirmed on blockchain

## üîç Error Handling

### Common Errors and Solutions

1. **"MetaMask is not installed"**
   - Solution: Install MetaMask browser extension

2. **"Contract address not configured"**
   - Solution: Deploy contracts and update environment variables

3. **"Transaction failed"**
   - Solution: Check gas fees, token balances, and wallet connection

4. **"Origin not found on Allowlist"**
   - Solution: This is now fixed with the updated WalletConnect configuration

## üß™ Testing

### Before Testing
1. Make sure MetaMask is installed and connected
2. Deploy contracts to testnet
3. Update contract addresses in environment variables
4. Have some ETH for gas fees

### Test Flow
1. Connect MetaMask wallet
2. Try minting SBT - should see MetaMask popup
3. Try making PYUSD payment - should see MetaMask popup
4. Check transactions on blockchain explorer

## üìä Benefits

- ‚úÖ **Real MetaMask transactions** instead of simulations
- ‚úÖ **Proper error handling** with user-friendly messages
- ‚úÖ **Transaction confirmation** with real transaction hashes
- ‚úÖ **Blockchain verification** with block numbers
- ‚úÖ **Gas fee handling** and proper transaction flow

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Deploy Contracts**: Deploy your contracts to testnet
2. **Update Addresses**: Update contract addresses in environment variables
3. **Test Integration**: Test the MetaMask integration
4. **Verify Transactions**: Check transactions on blockchain explorer

## üîß Troubleshooting

### If you still see errors:

1. **Clear browser cache** and refresh the page
2. **Check MetaMask connection** and network settings
3. **Verify contract addresses** are correct
4. **Check browser console** for detailed error messages
5. **Make sure contracts are deployed** to the correct network

The system now uses real MetaMask transactions with proper error handling and transaction confirmation!
